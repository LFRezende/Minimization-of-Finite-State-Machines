# Minimization of Finite State Machines

When studying electronic or computer engineering, one of the first subjects of the professional course regards building 
logic circuitry capable of certain abilities.

When regarding sequential circuits, it becomes necessary to study how to implement more efficient solutions.
One of the many ways to improve efficiency in this sort of circuitry is by minimizing the current states of your Finite State Machine - let it be asynchronous or synchronous.

## Usual procedures for state minimization
